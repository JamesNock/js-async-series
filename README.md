# Simple async.series demo

This project simply shows how to run two functions in series =.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the project root in your terminal
3. Install the `async` dependency by running `npm install`
4. Run `node combined.js`

## Notes

1. I used `nvm` and switched node to version 16 as I had memory problems using node version 12.
    - There is an `.nvrmrc` file included so if you're already setup with `nvm` then you should be good anyway.
